## How to file issues and get help

### Azure support tickets

While Data API builder is in public preview, it is not eligible for Microsoft support. Please use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/issues) to file bugs and feature requests.

### GitHub issues

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/azure/data-api-builder/issues) to track bugs, questions, and feature requests. GitHub Issues require you to have a GitHub account and are free to create. There is a GitHub Issue template to help you provide the information we need to investigate your issue.

We recommend that you search through the existing issues to see if there is a similar issue that you can comment on. If you find an existing issue, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.

When an issue is raised, a member of the team will respond as soon as possible, so please be patient.
