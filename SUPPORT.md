Data API builder is an open-source project with contributions from Microsoft and the community to build a configuration-based engine in a Docker-friendly container that easily adds a secure and feature-rich Data API over databases. 

## How to file issues and get help

### GitHub Issues

Engineers who contribute to and work on Data API builder periodically monitor and review issues added to [the repository's issues list](https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/issues). The period of review is not set by a service level agreement (SLA), and resolution is not guaranteed. When an issue is raised, a member of the team will respond as soon as possible; please be patient.

Repository issues track bugs, questions, and feature requests. Creating issues requires a GitHub account; issue templates prompt for details that will help engineers reproduce your issue and more effectively complete an investigation. Repository issues may be added to the backlog by engineers and become triaged in our future roadmap.

We recommend searching for existing issues similar to yours before creating a new one. Commenting on existing issues helps coalesce recurring issues and helps engineers evaluate severity and find better resolutions.

### Before Submitting an Issue

First, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. Use this [query](https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Aenhancement+) to search for the most popular feature requests.
If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment.
