# Getting started with Data API builder for Azure SQL Database or SQL Server

Make sure you have read the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) document.

As mentioned before, this tutorial assumes that you already have a SQL Server or an Azure SQL database that can be used as playground.

## Create a sample database

If you don't have a SQL Server or Azure SQL database, you can create one in Azure. You can use the Azure Portal or the Azure CLI. More details here: [Quickstart: Create a single database - Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart?view=azuresql&tabs=azure-portal)

## Get the database connection string

There are several ways to get an Azure SQL database connection string. More details here: [Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance connect and query articles](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/connect-query-content-reference-guide?view=azuresql)

If you are connecting to Azure SQL DB or Azure SQL MI, the connection string look like:

```text
Server=<server-address>;Database=<database-name>;User ID=<user-id>;Password=<password>;
```

To connect to a local SQL Server, remember to set the `TrustServerCertificate` property to `true`:

```text
Server=localhost;Database=<database-name>;User ID=<user-id>;Password=<password>;TrustServerCertificate=true;
```

More details on Azure SQL and SQL Server connection strings can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/connect/ado-net/connection-string-syntax

## Create the database objects

Create the database tables needed to represent Authors, Books and the many-to-many relationship between Authors and Books. You can use the [library.azure-sql.sql](../../samples/getting-started/azure-sql-db/library.azure-sql.sql) script to create three tables, along with sample data:

- `dbo.authors`: Table containing authors
- `dbo.books`: Table containing books
- `dbo.books_authors`: Table associating books with respective authors

Execute the script in the SQL Server or Azure SQL database you decided to use, so that the tables with sample data are created and populated.

## Creating a configuration file for DAB

The Data API builder for Azure Databases engine needs a [configuration file](../configuration-file.md). There you'll define which database DAB connects to, and which entities are to be exposed by the API, together with their properties.

For this getting started guide you will use DAB CLI to initialize your configuration file. Run the following command:

```shell
dab init --database-type "mssql" --connection-string "Server=localhost;Database=<database-name>;User ID=<user>;Password=<password>;TrustServerCertificate=true" --host-mode "Development"
```

Make sure to replace the placehoders (`<database-name>`, `<user>` and `<password>`) with the correct values for your database.

The command will generate a config file called `dab-config.json` looking like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/Azure/data-api-builder/releases/download/v{dab-version}/dab.draft.schema.json",
  "data-source": {
    "database-type": "mssql",
    "options": {
      "set-session-context": false
    },
    "connection-string": "Server=localhost;Database=<database-name>;User ID=<user>;Password=<password>;TrustServerCertificate=true"
  },
  "runtime": {
    "rest": {
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "/api"
    },
    "graphql": {
      "allow-introspection": true,
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "/graphql"
    },
    "host": {
      "mode": "development",
      "cors": {
        "origins": [],
        "allow-credentials": false
      },
      "authentication": {
        "provider": "StaticWebApps"
      }
    }
  },
  "entities": {}
}
```

As you can see there the `data-source` property specifies that our chosen `database-type` is `mssql`, with the `connection-string` we passed to DAB CLI.

> Take a look at the [DAB Configuration File Guide](../configuration-file.md) document to learn more.

With the configuration file in place, it's time to start defining which entities you want to expose via the API.

## Add Book and Author entities

Now, you'll want to expose the `dbo.books` and the `dbo.authors` table as REST or GraphQL endpoints. To do that, add the following information to the `entities` section of the configuration file.

You can do this either using the CLI:

```bash
dab add Author --source dbo.authors --permissions "anonymous:*"
```

or by adding the `Author` entity manually to the config file:

```json
"entities": {
  "Author": {
    "source": "dbo.authors",
    "permissions": [
      {
        "actions": ["*"],
        "role": "anonymous"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

within the `entities` object you can create any entity with any name (as long as it is valid for REST and GraphQL). The name `Author`, in this case, will be used to build the REST path and the GraphQL type. Within the entity you have the `source` element that specifies which table contains the entity data. In our case is `dbo.authors`.

> **NOTE**: Entities names are case sensitive, and they will be exposed via REST and GraphQL as you have typed them. Take a look at the [Best Practices](../best-practices.md) document to learn the best practices on entities names.

After that, the permissions for the exposed entity are defined via the `permission` element; it allows you to be sure that only those users making a request with the right claims will be able to access the entity and its data. In this getting started tutorial, we're allowing anyone, without the need to be authenticated, to perform all the CRUD operations to the `Author` entity.

You can also add the `Book` entity now, applying the same concepts you just learned for the `Author` entity. Once you have added the `Book` entity, the `entities` object of the configuration file will look like the following:

```json
"entities": {
    "Author": {
      "source": "dbo.authors",
      "permissions": [
        {
          "actions": ["*"],
          "role": "anonymous"
        }
      ]
    },
    "Book": {
      "source": "dbo.books",
      "permissions": [
        {
          "actions": ["*"],
          "role": "anonymous"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

that's all is needed at the moment. Data API builder is ready to be run.

> **BEST PRACTICE**: It is recommended to use the _singular_ form for entities names. For GraphQL, the Data API builder engine will automatically use the correct plural form to generate the final GraphQL schema whenever a _list_ of entity items will be returned. More on this behavior in the [GraphQL documentation](./../graphql.md).

> **BEST PRACTICE**: It is recommended to use Pascal Casing for the entity names, so that the generated GraphQL types, queries and mutations will be easier to read.

## Start Data API builder for Azure SQL Database

You are ready to serve your API. Run the below command (this will start the engine with default config `dab-config.json`, use option --config otherwise):

```bash
dab start
```

when you'll see something like:

```text
info: Azure.DataApiBuilder.Service.Startup[0]
      Successfully completed runtime initialization.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```

you'll be good to go, Data API Builder is up and running, ready to serve your requests.

## Query the endpoints

Now that Data API builder engine is running, you can use your favorite REST client ([Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download), for example) to query the REST or the GraphQL endpoints.

### REST Endpoint

REST endpoint is made available at the path (make sure to keep in mind that the url path is treated as case sensitive and must match the entity and path names defined in the configuration file):

```text
/api/<entity>
```

so if you want to get a list of all the available books you can simply run this GET request:

```text
/api/Book
```

The following HTTP verbs are supported:

- `GET`: return one or more items
- `POST`: create a new item
- `PUT` & `PATCH`: update or create an item
- `DELETE`: delete an item

Whenever you need to access a single item, you can get the item you want by specifying its primary key:

```text
GET /api/Book/id/1000
```

The ability to filter by primary key is supported by all verbs with the exception of POST as that verb is used to create a new item and therefore searching an item by its primary key is not applicable.

The GET verb also supports several query parameters (also case sensitive) that allow you to manipulate and refine the requested data:

- `$orderby`: return items in the specified order
- `$first`: the top `n` items to return
- `$filter`: expression to filter the returned items
- `$select`: list of field names to be returned

For more details on how they can be used, refer to the [REST documentation](../rest.md)

### GraphQL endpoint

GraphQL endpoint is available at

```text
/graphql
```

Use a GraphQL-capable REST client like Postman or Insomnia to query the database using full GraphQL introspection capabilities, to get intellisense and validation. For example:

```graphql
{
  books(first: 5, orderBy: { title: DESC }) {
    items {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

will return the first five books ordered by title in descending order.

## Adding entities relationships

Everything is now up and working, and now you probably want to take advantage as much as possible of GraphQL capabilities to handle complex queries by sending just one request. For example you may want to get all the Authors in your library along with the Books they have written. In order to achieve that you need to let Data API Builder know that you want such relationship to be available to be used in queries.

Stop the engine (`Ctrl+C`).

Relationships are also defined in the configuration file, via the `relationships` section. Relationships must be defined on each entity where you want to have them. For example to create a relationship between a Book and its Authors, you can use the following DAB CLI command:

```bash
dab update Author --relationship "books" --cardinality "many" --target.entity "Book" --linking.object "dbo.books_authors"
```

which will create the `relationships` section in the `Author` entity:

```json
"relationships": {
  "books": {
    "cardinality": "many",
    "target.entity": "Book",
    "linking.object": "dbo.books_authors"
  }
}
```

The element under `relationship` is used to add a field - `books` in the sample - to the generated GraphQL object, so that one will be able to navigate the relationship between an Author and their Books. Within the `books` element there are three fields:

- `cardinality`: set to `many` as an author can be associated with more than one book
- `target.entity`: Which entity, defined in the same configuration file, will be used in this relationship. For this sample is `Book` as we are creating the relationship on the `Author` entity.
- `linking.object`: the database table used to support the many-to-many relationship. That table is the `dbo.books_authors`. If you are creating a simple One-to-Many or Many-to-One relationship, this field is not needed.

Data API builder will automatically figure out what are the columns that are used to support the relationship between all the involved parts by analyzing the foreign key constraints that exist between the involved tables. For this reason the configuration is done! (If you don't have foreign keys you can always manually specify the columns you want to use to navigate from one table to another. More on this in the [relationships documentation](../relationships.md))

The `Author` entity should now look like the following:

```json
"Author": {
  "source": "dbo.authors",
  "permissions": [
    {
      "actions": [ "*" ],
      "role": "anonymous"
    }
  ],
  "relationships": {
    "books": {
      "cardinality": "many",
      "target.entity": "Book",
      "linking.object": "dbo.books_authors"
    }
  }
},
```

as we also want to enable querying a book and getting its authors, we also need to make a similar change to the book entity:

```bash
dab update Book --relationship "authors" --cardinality "many" --target.entity "Author" --linking.object "dbo.books_authors"
```

that will update the configuration file so that the `book` entity will look like the following code:

```json
"Book": {
  "source": "dbo.books",
  "permissions": [
    {
      "actions": [ "*" ],
      "role": "anonymous"
    }
  ],
  "relationships": {
    "authors": {
      "cardinality": "many",
      "target.entity": "Author",
      "linking.object": "dbo.books_authors"
    }
  }
}
```

Once this is done, you can now restart the Data API builder engine, and using GraphQL you can now execute queries like:

```graphql
{
  books(filter: { title: { eq: "Nightfall" } }) {
    items {
      id
      title
      authors {
        items {
          first_name
          last_name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

that will return all the authors of "Nightfall" book, or like:

```graphql
{
  authors(
    filter: {
      and: [{ first_name: { eq: "Isaac" } }, { last_name: { eq: "Asimov" } }]
    }
  ) {
    items {
      first_name
      last_name
      books {
        items {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

that will return all the books written by Isaac Asimov.

Congratulations, you have just created a fully working backend to support your modern applications!

## Exercise

If you want to practice what you have learned, here's a little exercise you can do on your own

- Using the database setup script [`/samples/getting-started/azure-sql-db/exercise/exercise.library.azure-sql.sql`](../../samples/getting-started/azure-sql-db/exercise/exercise-library.azure-sql.sql):
  - add the table `dbo.series` which will store series names (for example: [Foundation Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series))
  - update the `dbo.books` table by adding a column named `series_id`
  - update the `dbo.books` table by adding a foreign key constraint on the `dbo.series` table
- Update the configuration file with a new entity named `Series`, supported by the `dbo.series` source table you just created.
- Update the `Book` entity by creating a relationship with the `Series` entity. Make sure you select `one` for the `cardinality` property
- Update the `Series` entity by creating a relationship with the `Book` entity. Make sure you select `many` for the `cardinality` property
