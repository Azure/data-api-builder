## Ability to customize rest path via CLI

A new option `--rest.path` is introduced in the `init` command to customize the path for REST APIs. 

For Example:

Running the below command,
```text
dab init --database-type mssql --connection-string "Connection-String" --rest.path "rest-api" 
```
configures the REST endpoints with a prefix of `rest-api`. The complete path for the REST endpoints will be 
`https://<dab-server>/rest-api/<entity-name>`

When `--rest.path` option is not used, the REST endpoints will be configured with the default prefix `api`. The complete path in this case will be
`https://<dab-server>/api/<entity-name>`

## Data API builder container image in MAR

The official docker images for Data API builder for Azure Databases are now available in [Microsoft Artifact Registry](https://mcr.microsoft.com/product/azure-databases/data-api-builder/tags).

[This](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/product/azure-databases/data-api-builder/about) page contains the instructions for using the published images.

## Support for GraphQL fragments

Fragments are reusable part of a graphQL query. In scenarios where the same fields have to be queried in different queries, the repeated fields can be consolidated into a single reusable component called fragment. 

To read more about fragments, please visit [here](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)

A fragment called `description` on type `Character` is defined below

```graphql
fragment description on Character {
  name
  homePlanet
  primaryFunction
}
```

A GraphQL query that makes use of the above defined fragment can be constructed as shown

```graphql
{
  Player1: Player{
    id
    playerDescription{
        ...description
    }
  }
}
```
For the above query, the result will contain the following fields

```graphql
{
 Player1: Player{
    id
    playerDescription{
        name
        homePlanet
        primaryFunction
    }
  }   
}
```

## Turn on BinSkim and fix Policheck alerts

BinSkim is a Portable Executable (PE) light-weight scanner that validates compiler/linker settings and other security-relevant binary characteristics. A pipeline task in `static-tools` pipeline is added to perform BinSkim scans with every pipeline run. The PoliCheck system is a set of tools and data that helps stay compliant with the Text and Code Review Requirement, as part of the overall Global Readiness policy. The alerts generated by Policheck scans are fixed to be compliant with regards to sensitive terms.
